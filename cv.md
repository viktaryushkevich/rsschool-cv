Nowadays, I work as a **Frontend Developer** at VRP Consulting, developing every day. I try to learn smth new and immediately implement that in my everyday job. I extremely love my work  as it's really challenging. Thanks God, one of the projects I'm currently working on, is connected with the British office, where I can easily master both by skills and English. 
:dart: In future, I'd like to live abroad, for example in Poland, the Nederlands, Ireland or UK. My family supports me, so I'm trying my best to develop and get ready to move there one day.  
I'm 31, but I feel that I've found my *dream-job only in IT*. Being a Junior Dev, I have to learn and develop much quicker than my younger colleagues. In summer, I'm going to have my tech interview to become a **Mid Developer**.

Coming to Frontend :computer:, I already worked with WP websites using HTML, CSS, PHP. However, my prior occupation was a SEO and Internet Marketer. Then, I've developed my skills, using JS, HTML, PHP, Node JS, React, React Native, Express, different DBs (MongoDb, Postgres, MySQl..), Gatsby for static websites, a little bit of Angular. Also, I am aware of the current Git usage as well as Webpack and Gulp project flows. 
Now, I am learning Android to develop as a mobile dev.

My latest code was devoted to Mobile Menu BG change.

```javascript

let menuHamburger = document.querySelector('.js-hamburger');
let getBody = document.body;
menuHamburger.addEventListener('click', function () {
	getBody.classList.toggle('mobile-menu-show');
});

let mobileMenuHideLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.click-to-close-menu');

	if(mobileMenuHideLinks){ 
		mobileMenuHideLinks.forEach((elem)=> {
			elem.addEventListener('click', function () {
				getBody.classList.toggle('mobile-menu-show');
			});
		});
	}

```

Being a **Junior Dev** I have to learn and develop from day to day. Every day I have a possibility to work on website development projects at my current company, making my code more readable and easier to use.

I learn at HTMLAcademy, CodecademyPro, Udemy and Coursera as well as various resources like Codewars. Moreover, I'm currently learning online to get my qualification of a Software Engineer at the Faculty of Advanced Training and Staff Retraining in on of th Moscow institutions. In the past, I covered some courses in SEO, internet marketing, marketing, and copywriting. 
Also, I attend any regional and local IT events taking place either here or abroad.

Speaking about English, I graduated from **MSLU** :mortar_board: in 2011. I am happy to use English in my everyday projects, although, having an experience of working as a teacher of English at IBA, I do learn English myself. 

Moreover, I can remember me travelling abroad to **Sweden, Germany, Poland and Lithuania** where I spent some time for studies.
